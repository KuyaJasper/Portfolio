# Portfolio Project

For this project, I had to create a website with 3 sections: an About me section, a Work section, and a Contact info section.

To set my foundation I looked at previous lessons, and youtube videos to help me better understand what I needed to accomplish with Advance CSS properties (such as flex properties) as well as media queries.
