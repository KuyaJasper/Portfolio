# Portfolio
Advanced CSS Portfolio for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp


For this project, I had to create a website with 3 sections: an About me section, a Work section, and a Contact info section

To set my foundation I looked at previous lessons, and youtube videos to help me better understand what I needed to accomplish with Advance CSS properties (such as flex properties) as well as media queries

I did not have much time to put a lot of information, so I used a lorem ipsum generator and a place holder image of my late dog, Chewey.

I will be continually working to polish this up and will re submit at a later date.
